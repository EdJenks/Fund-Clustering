# Fund Clustering

This project leverages time series clustering techniques with the goal of identifying anomalies in funds valuation. The key idea is that similar investment funds tend to exhibit similar valuation patterns, and this characteristic can be used
to detect anomalies.

Data.csv contains historical data of the funds included. This dataset might contain inconsistencies and data quality issues.

cluster_composition is a CSV file that contains information about the cluster composition that's produced by the clustering algorithm.

Fund Clustering is a PDF that explains the feature engineering and agglomerative clustering algorithm in detail. In addition, some potential improvements are included in this pdf.

To run the app, users need to install the requirements, and simply call qd.py.
